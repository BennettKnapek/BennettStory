One day, a man named Tom went into the liquor store to buy some snacks. He realized that he didn't have any money so he decided to put a bag of chips into his pockets. Next thing he knew, he was getting chased out of the store by the manager.

Tom ran out of the store faster than he had ever ran before. The store manager simply could not keep up. Clutching the chips close to his chest, he turned the corner of the block and ran free.

Free at last with his chips, he thought. As he popped open the bag, the smell of the salty chips made him famished. However, unbeknownst to him, the manager's sense of smell was better than that of a bloodhound. Within moments, the manager had finally found Tom.
